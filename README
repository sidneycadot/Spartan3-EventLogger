This repository will hold a design for a logical analyzer based on the Spartan-3 develpment board.

VHDL:

- input section: monitor digital lines for change.
- if changes are detected, push them into a FIFO.
- output section: when a change is available in the FIFO, publish it to the RS-232.
- RS-232 out format:

{timestamp:64} {event-nr:64} {bit-state:64} <crc:32><CR><LF>

each event: 16 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 8 + 2 == 61 RS-232 characters

115200 [bauds / second] / 10 [bauds / character] / 61 [characters / event] == 188.5 [events / second] is sustainable.

* Open questions: will we use board RAM or the coregen FIFO?

* Show status via the digital counter
* Show blinking lights on activity
* Show 1 PPS blinking light
* Show FIFO status (EMPTY / FULL)
